Github search app

It is required to create a single page application,
which lists the repositories and organizations by search term.
Use api.github.com to get data.
Use React or React Native. Hooks and functional components.


Optional but bonus requirements:
Use any external State management (Redux is preferred). 
Use any Types checking (Typescript is prefered).
UI - reproduce the most similar layout. Web developers should use scss/sass and responsive styles, for React Native use styled-components for styling UI components.
For RN developers there should be a splash screen and app icon (UI on your wishes).
Search should have debounce input (means that request for the data should be after 300-500 ms after the user finished printing text, not with Enter press or other).
Previous requests are shown in the history module, the maximum number of  displayed requests is 5 (meaning that we should keep 5 new results, and if we add the new one, the first result should be deleted). History should be available after reloading the page or mobile application.
If there are results, the user should be able to press on the result and redirected to the GIT repo.


Expected Result:
Git Repository link.
Completed ReadMe file for the project.
A link to a demo is desirable for web developers (https://pages.github.com/).
